# Veto
## Network Security Project
Veto Application is an android app focused mainly on military communication. It uses TwoFish encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt a message. The main functionality of the app is that it aids a two-way secure conversation between two devices using a key. The app security is device-oriented, which means that message is encrypted on the sender device using the key, and similarly, the message is decrypted on the recipient device using the same key. So even if any third party hacks the key somehow on the server, it will be able to see the encrypted message only.
